# Commentary

## Overall

Overall life expectancy trend is positive. Though, it seems that the variance in life expectancy in European countries in 1952 was smaller compared to all other continents (exc. Oceania), this still seems to hold at the end of the observation period. With African countries' life expectancies still being quite spread apart.

## Germany

Life expectancy in Germany has been almost linearly increasing since 1952. Nowadays, people on average are expected to live around 80 years, which seems quite an increase from around 68 years in 1952. A period of strong economic growth, accompanied by progress in the medical / health area seem to drive this positive trend.
